#Commit message format

Commit messages are to be formated as:

    [file] explanation

If changing multiple files, add multi line commit message like:

    [file1] explanation1
    [file2] explanation2

File changes are never to be combined, so if changing 2 functionalities in the same file, 2 separate lines must be provided.
