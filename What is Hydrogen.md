#What is it, and what it isn't

Hydrogen is a monolithic kernel, its designed to be simple and have a simple codebase.

Its not made to replace Linux or any other system, its not made to compete with any system, instead it aims to be something different and have features like:

* Extensive hardware support, with emphasis on network hardware
* Support for multiple and also niche architectures (amd64, SPARC, POWER, ARM and MIPS4k are planned)
* Support for legacy hardware
* Good documentation
* Simple and well-written code
